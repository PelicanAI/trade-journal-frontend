    question: 'How is this different from ChatGPT?',
    answer:
      "ChatGPT doesn't have live market data, doesn't know your positions, can't track your setups, and forgets everything between conversations. Pelican pulls real-time market data, remembers your entire trading history, and gets more personalized every day you use it.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What markets does Pelican support?',
    answer:
      'Stocks, forex, crypto, and futures. When you sign up, you tell Pelican what you trade and the entire platform adapts — heatmap views, session indicators, morning briefings, and suggested analysis all match your market.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my trading data secure?',
    answer:
      "Yes. Every table in the database has row-level security policies. Your trades, journal entries, and playbooks are only accessible to you. We don't sell your data or share it with third parties.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'credits' mean?",
    answer:
      'Each AI query uses credits based on complexity. Simple questions use fewer credits, deep analysis uses more. Your monthly plan includes a set number that refresh each billing cycle.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I import my existing trades?',
    answer:
      'Broker CSV import is on the roadmap. For now, you can log trades manually (takes about 15 seconds per trade) or log them directly from chat.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be an experienced trader?',
    answer:
      "No. Pelican adapts to your level. Beginners get explained concepts and guided analysis. Advanced traders get technical depth and setup-specific coaching. Learning Mode highlights any term you don't recognize.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    answer:
      'Yes. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Your data stays accessible on the free tier if you downgrade.',
