      },
      {
        question: 'What makes Pelican different from other trading tools?',
        answer: 'Unlike traditional platforms that require coding skills or complex interfaces, Pelican uses natural language. Just ask questions like "What caused TSLA to drop yesterday?" or "Compare AAPL vs SPY last quarter" and get instant, actionable insights. One tool instead of 20 browser tabs.',
      },
      {

      },
      {
        question: 'What is Context Memory?',
        answer: 'Pelican remembers your trading style, preferences, and past conversations. This means responses get more personalized over time, and you don\'t have to repeat yourself. It\'s like having an assistant who truly knows how you trade.',

    icon: '',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How does Pelican\'s pricing work?',
        answer: 'Pelican uses a credit-based pricing system. Credits represent analytical workload—simple queries cost fewer credits, complex analyses cost more. Credits reset monthly and do not roll over.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the subscription tiers?',
        answer: 'Three tiers: Starter ($29/month, 1,000 credits) for exploration and learning, Pro ($99/month, 3,500 credits) for active traders, and Power ($249/month, 10,000 credits) for heavy and professional users.',

      {
        question: 'Is there a free tier or trial?',
        answer: 'Every new account gets 10 free questions to try Pelican before subscribing. No credit card required. After that, choose a plan that fits your trading style.',
