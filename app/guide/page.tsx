              <strong>Step 1 — Check the Daily Brief</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the Brief page first thing. In one glance you see your open
              positions and how they moved overnight, today&apos;s economic events
              and when they drop, which market sessions are open right now, top
              gaining and losing stocks, and market sentiment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Brief replaces your morning routine of checking CNBC, Yahoo
              Finance, the economic calendar, and your broker app. It&apos;s all
              here.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Step 2 — Scan Your Positions</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Your open positions on the Brief page show live P&amp;L. Check for
              positions approaching your target or stop, outsized winners you
              might want to trim, and anything that moved significantly
              overnight.

            <p>
              <strong>Step 3 — Check the Earnings Calendar</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              See who&apos;s reporting today and this week. If any of your positions
              have earnings coming, Pelican can preview what to watch for.
            </p>

              earnings preview with EPS estimates, revenue expectations, and what
              the market is pricing in.

            <p>
              When you enter a position, log it in Pelican. Takes 30 seconds:
              ticker, direction, entry price, stop loss, take profit, your
              thesis, conviction level, and setup tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your thesis is the most valuable field. When you review losing
              trades later, the thesis tells you whether your analysis was wrong
              or your execution was wrong. That&apos;s how you improve.

              When you exit, close the trade in Pelican and add notes on what
              happened and what mistakes you made. Pelican calculates your
              P&amp;L, R-multiple, and win rate automatically.

            </p>
            <p>
              Hit the SCAN button next to any open position. Pelican reviews
              your trade with full context — entry, stop, target, thesis,
              current price — and gives you an updated read. Do this at least
              once a week per position.

            </p>
            <p>
              Your Positions dashboard shows portfolio allocation, P&amp;L by
              position, risk concentration warnings, win rate, equity curve, and
              drawdown. Check it weekly. Look for patterns: are you better at
              longs or shorts? Do you cut winners too early? Do Fridays
              consistently hurt you?

            <p>
              The S&amp;P 500 heatmap shows you the entire market in one view.
              Green is up, red is down, size is market cap. In 3 seconds you
              know whether money is flowing into tech or out of it, which
              sectors are leading, and whether this is a broad rally or narrow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Click any stock on the heatmap — Pelican instantly analyzes why
              it&apos;s moving and whether it matters for your portfolio.

              <strong>The Correlation Page</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              See how assets move relative to each other. If you hold NVDA and
              AVGO and they&apos;re 0.87 correlated, you&apos;re essentially running
              double the semiconductor risk. The correlation matrix helps you
              diversify intelligently.
