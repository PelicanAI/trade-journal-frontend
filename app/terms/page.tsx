          <h2>2. NATURE OF SERVICES - CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED STRICTLY FOR INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            PELICAN IS NOT A BROKER-DEALER, INVESTMENT ADVISOR, FINANCIAL ADVISOR, COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR, FINANCIAL PLANNER, FIDUCIARY, OR TAX ADVISOR. THE SERVICES DO NOT CONSTITUTE INVESTMENT ADVICE, FINANCIAL ADVICE, TRADING ADVICE, TAX ADVICE, LEGAL ADVICE, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing provided through the Services should be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, hold, or otherwise transact in any security, derivative, commodity, or financial instrument.

        <section>
          <h2>3. AI-GENERATED CONTENT DISCLAIMERS</h2>
          <p>
            The Services utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, large language models, and algorithmic systems (collectively, &quot;AI Systems&quot;) that may produce errors, inaccuracies, hallucinations, biases, or misleading information. AI-generated content may appear authoritative but could be partially or entirely incorrect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, SUITABILITY, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY AI-GENERATED CONTENT.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTE AND NON-DELEGABLE OBLIGATION TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY ALL INFORMATION THROUGH AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION.

        <section>
          <h2>4. RISK DISCLOSURES</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>TRADING AND INVESTING IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR EVERY PERSON. YOU CAN LOSE ALL OR MORE THAN YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            THE SERVICES DO NOT GUARANTEE PROFITABILITY, POSITIVE RETURNS, OR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. Most traders lose money. You should be prepared to lose all funds used for trading.
